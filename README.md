# TIC80 LSP function definitions

Lua function definitions for [TIC80](https://tic80.com/) functions.
It generates a addon which [lua-language-serve](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server) can understand.
The generator script works by scraping github wiki page for tic80 https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki.

There is a tutorial [here](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/wiki/Addons) where it explains how
to use addons made for the lua language server.
